# JitterAlarm

Originally a project for the 2016 Congressional App Challenge, this alarm management app is being expanded into a higher-functionality, more artistically not-unpleasing, and more cleanly written lifestyle tool.

Jitter Alarm allows the user to schedule alarms to trigger at a chosen of specified days of the week. What makes this project stand apart from existing alarm applications is that it works to prevent subconscious ignoring of alarms through randomly offset activation times and randomly selected alarm tones. Never forget your alarms for important activities again!
